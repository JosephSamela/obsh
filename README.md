# obsh
A tiny bash script that scans your local networks for clients with SSH daemon running on the standard port, and then drops a shell for every client found. Useful for penetration testing and headless setups (Raspberry Pi et al.).  
The name is an acronym that means "obscure shell", which is a weak pun on "secure shell".
